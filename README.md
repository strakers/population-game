# Population game

This is a version of the population game I created way back in 2013, from an idea I had in 2005. At the time, I had wanted to create a simple and fun project to put into application my knowledge around manipulating global, instance, and inherited data within a single ecosystem.

The concept of the game is simple: manage the individuals of the world throughout their life spans, across personal relations and international migrations. Think SIMS, but 2D, and much more limited.

The world has a universal timer, so individuals will grow in age as time progresses. Population increases naturally as individuals get pregnant and eventually give birth, while population decreases when individuals get old and pass away. Players are able to assign individuals to countries, which increase/decrease a country's population count, as well as selecting pairings of individuals for mating.

Admittedly, the initial version of the game was extremely simple in nature with very apparent limitations and bias (only 2 countries, binary pairings, male-initiation, no visual timer, and set individuals - to new a few), and also ignores many nuanced complexities of society. These should be addressed and improved upon through future developer efforts.
