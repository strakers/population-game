# Population game

This is a version of the population game I created way back in 2013, from an idea I had in 2005. The goal of the game is simple - propogate the land! Manage the individuals of the world throughout their life spans, across relations and international migrations.

The world has a universal timer, so individuals will grow in age as time progresses. Population increases naturally as individuals get pregnant and eventually give birth, while population decreases when individuals get old and pass away. Players are able to assign individuals to countries, which increase/decrease a country's population count, as well as selecting pairings of individuals for mating.

The initial version of the game is quite simple in nature, with very apparent limitations (only 2 countries, binary pairings, male-initiation, no visual timer, and set individuals), but these may be improved (via developer effort) as time progresses.
